== Introduction

{gr8crm} is a set of http://www.grails.org/[Grails Web Application Framework]
plugins that makes it easy to develop web applications with CRM functionality.

You can find more information about {gr8crm} on the main documentation site {homepage}.

=== Customer Relationship Management

Customer relationship management (CRM) is a system for managing a company’s interactions with current and future customers.
It involves using technology to organize, automate and synchronize sales, marketing, customer service, and technical support.
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Customer_relationship_management[Wikipedia]

The {gr8crm} "Ecosystem" currently contains over 40 Grails plugins. For a complete list of plugins see {homepage}.

Each {gr8crm} plugin defines a http://martinfowler.com/bliki/BoundedContext.html[Bounded Context]
that focus on one specific domain, for example *contact*, *project* or *document*.

== Project Management User Interface Plugin

The `crm-project-ui` plugin provides a Twitter Bootstrap user interface for managing all kind of projects.
It depends on the `crm-project` plugin for low level services and persistence.

TIP: The crm-project-ui plugin does not contain support for monetary information like project value or currency.
For monetary project like sales leads and opportunities you should use the +crm-sales+ and +crm-sales-ui+ plugins.

== Project Roles

A project can have multiple people assigned to different roles. You can specify the project manager that will
lead the project, or the sales support staff that are assigned to the project. As an administrator you can add as
many role types as you want. These roles can then be used to assign people to the project.

To add a role other than customer and contact you press the [Add role] button on the Roles tab. You can add contacts
already in your address book or create a new contact by entering new name.
The new contact will be added to your address book when you save the project.

== Project resources

When creating or updating a project you can select the responsible project manager from a dropdown list.
This dropdown list is populated using an application event `crmTenant.getUsers`. You must add an event listener in
one of your application services that listens to this event and returns a list of users (project people).

For a list of *all* registered users you can add something like this to a service in your application:

[source,groovy]
.MyApplicationService.groovy
----
@Listener(namespace="crmTenant", topic="getUsers")
def listAllUsersInTenant(data) {
    CrmUserRole.createCriteria().list(sort: 'user.name', order: 'asc') {
        resultTransformer CriteriaSpecification.ALIAS_TO_ENTITY_MAP
        projections {
            user {
                property('id', 'id')
                property('guid', 'guid')
                property('username', 'username')
                property('name', 'name')
                property('email', 'email')
            }
        }
        role {
            eq('tenantId', data.tenant)
        }
    }
}
----
